Under the Oneko folder you find a simple VBS app that runs a script by Cesar Gimenes (https://github.com/crgimenes/neko.git)
I simply took Cesar's script and gave it a UI that people can interact with, its made with Windows Forms in PowerShell.
The goal of this project was to learn how to make a simple UI that anyone can dowload and use to run this script.

Features:
Runs in the background, this progame with stay hidden in the taskbar icons, so it wont take up space or on workspace! 
Just double click the icon to open the app and adjust the size, speed and if you want it to make sounds.

TODO:
Add profiles for diffrent animals or skins
